# About the course
On this project, we try to build the training material for ReactJS developers. These are the fundamentals knowledge, not only React Native, we also mention Redux and other libraries. That will help the developer can build a ReactJS application from scratch.

We try to use the official documents from the framworks/platforms/libraries as much as posible. That will avoid our bias (personal point of view) on transfering knowdledge. For some things that we can't not found clearly explaination from offical documents, we use ourseft document/example.

The videos for this course were published on Youtube, you can found them on the chanel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFM3plFG0QUavW1FPfize7g/playlists?view_as=subscriber
